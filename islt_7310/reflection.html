                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>My career has consisted of three major positions: teacher, instructional technology specialist, and library media specialist. Although all three were vastly different in my job responsibilities and day to day work, I have been able to learn from each one to mold my career into what it is today. Teaching in the classroom taught me so much about working with children and the reality of being a teacher. Instructional technology gave me the skills to support teachers with technology as well as make connections to learn more. My current position as a library media specialist allows me to combine everything I have learned to create a program that benefits both students and teachers. 
                </p>
                <p>I learned quickly my first year of teaching that students feed off of your energy, in more ways than one. All teachers know to be a good role model for students, and model behavior that you would want your students to emulate. However, teaching in the classroom taught me that I can mold and shape what students value at a young age. If I introduced something as exciting and cool, they would go along with me. My goal in my library today is that students truly believe it is my favorite place in the whole world. I want them to walk in feeling welcome and excited, and I will model that every day. I also learned that teaching is relationships first. A student learns best in an environment they feel safe and respected in, and that requires relationship building.
                </p>
                <p>My job as an instructional technology specialist taught me the skills I need to do my current job as a library media specialist. I feel much more confident doing simple fixes for technology, helping my teachers quickly and getting them back up and doing what they ended to do for students. I also learned the language of instructional technology, as well as who to contact within my district for help. This has proven so valuable during my new position, and is something I will always remember - professionalism and getting to know those around you will always serve you well. 
                </p>
                <p>In my current job as a library media specialist I am able to use everything I have learned and put it to use. This is a job that I thought I would not have until later in my career, but am thrilled it came so early. My career goal is this position, and I look forward to continuing to improve the program for years to come. My philosophy in this position can be boiled down to this: students, then teachers, then me. I always drop what I am doing to help a student, then the teachers, then my own work. This has helped me to keep the goal in mind in a job where I might not interact with students all the time. I am thankful for everything I have learned and look forward to continuing to grow in the field of education.
