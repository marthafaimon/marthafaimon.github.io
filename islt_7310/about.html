          <p>My name is Martha Faimon, and I am an elementary library media specialist. This is my first year with this job, and what a year it has been! I am passionate about learning with technology and reading, so this job has been a perfect fit. In my free time I enjoy watching scary movies with my husband, biking on my Peloton, and reading.</p>
          <p>I am currently in graduate school studying information and library sciences focusing on technology in schools. My bachelor’s is from the University of Nebraska, specifically in Inclusive Early Childhood Education. I am certified to teach kindergarten through third grade, as well as early childhood, including early childhood special education. After graduating I taught third grade for three years in Nebraska. In 2017 I went through an iPad training program provided by my district, called iPad Academy. During that time I also completed Apple Teacher certification. In 2018 I moved to Missouri to work with teachers using technology as an instructional technology specialist for my district. I then returned to the classroom to teach first grade for a year. Now, as a library media specialist, I get to focus on both education technology and reading. I look forward to learning more in this position and continuing in the field of education technology.</p>
