     <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Martha Faimon, and I am an elementary <strong>media specialist</strong> in Missouri. My <em>previous</em> experience with web development consists of <em>websites</em> that I put premade things into, such as Google Sites and Weebly. I do not have any experience with HTML or writing code, but I am looking forward to learning more. I hope to learn about what goes into creating websites and be able to be more knowledgeable on the behind the scenes of the technologies I use. I am in charge of my schoolâ€™s website, and there is an HTML component I have never looked into. I could use the learning from this course to explore that option.</p> <p> In my free time I love to journal and read, as well as watch <em>scary movies</em> with my husband.  <br> I also enjoy being active by biking on my Peloton and running outside. </p>
