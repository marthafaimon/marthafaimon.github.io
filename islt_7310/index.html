                <p>The purpose of this website is to share about my professional career, as well as my current projects and studies towards my graduate degree. I will be including my projects and experiences, including information about my studies in learning technologies and library experience. I will also discuss my personal philosophy and reflection on how I came to form that philosophy. I hope that visiting this website will give the reader a better understanding of my education and professional life, as well as how I got to this point in my career. I would also like this website to serve as a place I can update as my career and learning continues. I will continue doing projects and having experiences during my time in graduate school and would appreciate having a place to update and share as I continue to learn. I hope readers learn more about my journey and experience!</p>
