                <p>Seesaw is an online portfolio app for students. It has been updated to be quite robust in the last few years, bringing it beyond just a host of finished work for students. Students can take photos, draw, comment, add video, and manipulate all sorts of assignments created by teachers. I used it extensievly with my first grade students when I was in the classroom.</p>
                <p>The first example is a video created by a student. They completed their assignment off of the iPad, by cutting, gluing, and sorting their words. Then, they took a picture and put it into Seesaw. The final part was reading their words aloud and recording in Seesaw for me to hear. Seesaw allowed me to get a full picture of their understanding of the assignment and see what specific support I needed to give each student.</p>
                <p>The second example is a photo from a Seesaw assignment. Students were to create different numbers with their place value blocks, then photograph and mark the number in Seesaw. This is one photo of many they did. It was a great way to incorporate hands-on manipulatives with educational technology.</p>

                <p>Explain Everything is a multi use app for the classroom. Teachers can use it to create video lessons and tutorials for students, as well as record their thinking as a recordable whiteboard. Students can also use it to record thinking, as a way to record their work in real time. It can also be used simply as a digital whiteboard for students.</p>
                <p>This tutorial was created for teachers to get them ready to use the app successfully with students.</p>

                <p>We were faced with quite a few challenges when starting school online this past fall, one of which being how to get students reading while not having access to the school library. Sora was incredibly helpful with this. Sora is a host for onilne reading, with books for students to check out and read on their iPads. We were also happy to partner with our local public library to get students access to their online book catalog.</p>
                <p>This Google presentation was created to show students via Zoom how to set up their account and read from home. It was also shared with parents and teachers to give students something to refer back to if they had any questions.</p>
