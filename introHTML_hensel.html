               <title>Welcome to Martha Faimon (Hensel's) Website</title>
</head>
<body>

     My name is Martha Faimon, and I am an elementary media specialist in Missouri. My previous experience with web development consists of websites that I put premade things into, such as Google Sites and Weebly. I do not have any experience with HTML or writing code, but I am looking forward to learning more. I hope to learn about what goes into creating websites and be able to be more knowledgeable on the behind the scenes of the technologies I use. I am in charge of my schoolâ€™s website, and there is an HTML component I have never looked into. I could use the learning from this course to explore that option. In my free time I love to journal and read, as well as watch scary movies with my husband.  I also enjoy being active by biking on my Peloton and running outside.
